## Instructions

This GitHub repository contains the data extraction and manipulation of the data used in this thesis project.  
The files are organised according to the data set.  
Each data set contains an R script which performs all the data calculations.  
The scripts are heavily annotated and are ready to be executed.    
Each data set contains all necessary data files as well as the intermediate and final data products.  
Some files are too large to be added to GitHub. These files are freely downloadable from included links.  
Finally, each data set contains elaborated README files with detailed information on all the files and the included data.  
The user will find all relevant metadata in the README files or links to very detailed information on the raw data.

### BCI - Barro Colorado Island data set

This directory contains all files for the data manipulation for the BCI tropical forest data set.  
This data is used in this thesis for the analysis with the Analytical Models.  
Only diversity data is used for this analysis.

### NABB - North American Breeding Birds data set

This directory contains all files for the data manipulation for the NABB data set.  
This data is used in this thesis for the analysis with the Mechanistic Model and the Analytical Models.  
The data set contains diversity data and environment data extracted from different sources.

### CPR - Continuous Plankton Recorder data set

This directory contains all files for the data manipulation for the CPR data set.  
This data is used in this thesis for the analysis with the Mechanistic Model.  
The data set contains diversity data and environment data extracted from different sources.
