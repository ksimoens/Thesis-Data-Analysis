## Data extraction for the CPR analysis

---

### CPR_extractData.R

R-script to perform the data extraction and manipulation.  
Maps are created as well.  
Constructed in R version 4.3 ("Already Tomorrow").  
Read comments in the code to avoid problems with memory usage.

### CPR_env.zip

zip-file with all the downloaded data on environment.   
Downloadable from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HJ-QKm95RALnsqqGJZJo9WAxAD1Eoao4?usp=drive_link   
The file is unzipped automatically in **CPR_extractData.R**.  
Therefore, **CPR_extractData.R** has to be placed in the same directory as the zip-file. 
<br/>
The zip-file contains:  

- *CPR_temp.tif*: North Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature data  
The data is downloaded from Bio-ORACLE using the R package sdmpredictors.  
Details on the data format can be found here: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00656.x .

- *CPR_phyto.tif*: North Atlantic phytoplankton concentration data  
The data is downloaded from Bio-ORACLE using the R package sdmpredictors.  
Details on the data format can be found here: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00656.x .

- *CPR_velo_x.nc*: North Atlantic zonal current velocity data  
The data is downloaded from Copernicus: https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00016  .
Details on the data format can be found under this link.

- *CPR_velo_x.nc*: North Atlantic meridional current velocity data  
The data is downloaded from Copernicus: https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00016  .
